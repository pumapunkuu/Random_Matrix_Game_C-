# Random_Matrix_Game_C-
This code was written in c++ and intended to create a SUDOKU game.
With https://github.com/galtonova this project was made.
Idea is creating random values between 0-9 in a Sudoku table everytime we run the program.
For that srand and rand functions were used
At the first time we created a matris and idea is to assign them to another empty matris randomly.
