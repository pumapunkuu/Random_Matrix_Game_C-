# Random_Matrix_Game_C-
This code was written in c++ and intended to create a SUDOKU game.
With https://github.com/galtonova this project was made.
Idea is creating random values between 0-9 in a Sudoku table everytime we run the program.
For that srand and rand functions were used
At the first time we created a matris and idea is to assign them to another empty matris randomly.
In the original code was written in windows so instead of stdlib.h windows.h can be usable.But in mac platforms to run
the program you should update the path or you would be getting some include error.
